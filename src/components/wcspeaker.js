          Jen is a west coast born Canadian, raised on God with her toes in the ocean and her back to the mountains. She is a speaker and writer and is determined to live up to Romans 12:1, honoring God from the inside out, a living sacrifice. Family, Friends and keeping active is part of her day to day life! While any (and almost all) outdoor activity will suite the bill, volleyball is the sport of choice closely followed by surfing on her visits out west.
